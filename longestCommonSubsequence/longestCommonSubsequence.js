 * @param {*} string
 * The longest common subsecence(LCS) problem is the problem of finding the longest subsequence that is present in both sequences AND in the same order. i.e., find the longest sequence which can be obtained from the first original sequence by deleting some items, and from the second original sequence by deleting other items
 *
 * This problem differs from problems of finding common substrings. Unlike substrings, subsequences are not require to occupy consecutive positions within the original sequences
 *
 * For example, consider the two following sequences:
 *
 * x = 'abcbdab
 * y = 'bdcaba
 *
 * The length of LCS is 4, and the LCS are 'bdab', 'bcab', and 'bcba'
